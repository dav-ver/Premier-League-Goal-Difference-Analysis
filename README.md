# Premier-League-Goal-Difference-Analysis
A bunch of investigations into goal difference trends and records in the Premier League era. I wrote all the code in late 2018, It's all in base R and sometimes kinda convoluted - I hadn't discoved the tidyverse by this time.  
Analysis includes:
- Maximum goal diff gain or loss over given number of games
